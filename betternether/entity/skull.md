## Description:
The Wither's Skull entity is a projectile spawned by the Wither that flies towards its target before exploding into a large explosion. When thrown, it will automatically home in on its target and deal damage upon impact. The skull has limited uses for survival players, such as breaking Nether portals or destroying blocks with its explosion.
