## Description:
The Flying Pig is an entity that can be found in Nether Fortresses. It will initially spawn roosting on the walls of the fortress, occasionally taking to the air to fly around and search for food. When it finds a nearby food source, such as a stack of seeds or wheat, it will fly towards it and attempt to eat it.
