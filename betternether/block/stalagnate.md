## Description:
The Stalagnate block is a type of wood-based plant that can grow and change shape as it grows, with different shapes and behaviors depending on the surrounding environment. It has a unique ability to adjust its collision box to interact properly with players and other blocks in various situations, making it useful for building and gameplay purposes. When placed or spawned, Stalagnate plants do not drop themselves, but can be harvested as part of a larger structure.
