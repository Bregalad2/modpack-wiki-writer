## Description:
The Stalactite block is a type of stone that can grow downwards into the rock below it, extending its size as it does so. It can also absorb nearby Stalactite blocks, growing in size by absorbing smaller ones. This behavior allows the Stalactite to continue growing and taking up more space, potentially affecting other blocks around it.

Drops itself when broken.
