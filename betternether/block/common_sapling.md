## Description:
The Common Sapling is a type of plant block found in The Nether. It can grow into a tree when placed on solid nether ground, making it a source for obtaining wood in this dark and hellish realm. As a sapling, it has a limited ability to survive on top of certain blocks, but can thrive when planted on the ground where it belongs.

Drops itself when broken.
