## Description:
The Giant Lucis is a plant-like block that can be mined with an axe. When mined with a tool made of certain materials, it has a chance to drop spores or glowstone piles, providing useful resources for players. Its walkable property makes it safe to stand on, allowing players to traverse the surrounding area without fear of falling damage.

Drops itself when broken.
