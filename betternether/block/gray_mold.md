## Description:
The Gray Mold is a type of fungus that can grow on the ground. It has a rare chance to drop spores when mined, which can spread to other blocks if they are within range. When grown in large enough quantities, the spores will continue to grow and eventually form new mold growths.

Drops itself when broken.
