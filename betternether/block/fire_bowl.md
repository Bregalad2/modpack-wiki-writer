## Description:
The Fire Bowl is a block that can be used to create small fires when interacted with using a flint and steel. When lit, it behaves similarly to regular fire blocks, burning until extinguished by water or lava. However, unlike regular fire, the Fire Bowl can be put out and relit at will, making it useful for controlled flame applications in crafting recipes.

Drops itself when broken.
