## Description:
The Common Plant is a block that grows on nether soil, slowly growing up to three stages of maturity. It can grow into other blocks, including itself, if the surrounding terrain is fertile and there are no obstacles in its way. When fully grown, it will not drop as an item when broken, but will instead remain intact.
