## Description:
The Ink Bush is a plant-like block that can grow on Nether Ground. It has a unique growth cycle where it reaches its full height after three days, and then begins to decline. The Ink Bush seed can be obtained when the block is harvested, allowing players to replant and maintain a thriving ink bush in their Nether biome.

Drops itself when broken.
