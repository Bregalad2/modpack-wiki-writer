## Description:
The Nether Grass block is a type of terrain block that can grow on top of certain blocks like Netherrack, Nylium, and Sculk. It does not require sunlight to survive, allowing it to thrive in areas with limited or no direct light. This makes it useful for creating structures and landscapes in the Nether that would be difficult to maintain otherwise.

Drops itself when broken.
