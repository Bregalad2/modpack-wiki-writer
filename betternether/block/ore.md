## Description:
The BlockOre is an ore that can be mined like regular stone, but it drops items at a rate based on its levels of difficulty to mine. When mined by hand or with a pickaxe, the BlockOre will drop one or more items depending on its level and the player's mining level. This block is also resistant to fire damage, making it useful for areas where lava or fire are present.

Drops itself when broken.
