## Description:
The Netherrack Furnace is an item-processing block that allows players to smelt minerals and cook food using Nether Bricks as fuel. It has three slots for inputting items: one for the fuel source, one for the mineral or food being processed, and a slot for storing the resulting output. The furnace's processing speed and energy efficiency depend on the type of fuel used.

Drops itself when broken.
