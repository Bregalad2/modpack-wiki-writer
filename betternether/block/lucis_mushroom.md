## Description:
The Lucis Mushroom is a walkable plant block that can be used to create paths and roads. It allows players to traverse the terrain like any other solid block, and can be combined with other blocks to create intricate designs. The Lucis Mushroom also serves as a host for Lucis Spores, which can be mined by right-clicking on it with an axe.
