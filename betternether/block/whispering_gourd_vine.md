## Description:
The Whispering Gourd vine block is a type of plant that grows in the nether and can have different growth stages, represented by three different types of blocks: bottom, middle, and top. When broken with shears, it drops seeds which can grow into new vines. The growth stage affects how quickly and easily the vine regenerates, but breaking or harvesting the block at a specific stage can cause it to change to another type.
