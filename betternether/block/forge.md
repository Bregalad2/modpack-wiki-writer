## Description:
The Cincinnaite Forge is a portable furnace that can fuel crafting tables with fuel sources such as wood or coal, allowing players to craft items more quickly in the wilderness. It works similarly to an ordinary furnace, but its speed is increased by half when fueled. When used by a player, it also triggers the "Used Forge" advancement criterion.

Drops itself when broken.
