# Bone reef
The Netherbone Reef Biome is a unique and eerie addition to the BetterNether mod's diverse array of biomes. This biome takes inspiration from the natural world, with sprawling underwater-like structures made up of twisted, bone-white coral and rock formations that jut out of the ground like skeletal fingers. The air is thick with an otherworldly energy, as if the very fabric of reality has been warped and distorted in this forsaken place. As you explore the reef, you'll notice a strange, pulsing glow emanating from certain areas - a phenomenon known to be caused by the eerie bioluminescent creatures that call this biome home. The sound of dripping water and faint whispers seem to echo through the air, adding to the sense of unease that pervades this foreboding environment. Overall, the Netherbone Reef Biome is a place where the boundaries between reality and nightmare are blissfully blurred, inviting brave adventurers to explore its twisted depths.
